Steps to setup a development environment for the backend:
- Ensure you have Java 21 installed. Available at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21 (open command prompt/terminal and type java -version to check)
- Copy the path location of the Java 21 installation, and add it to the "java.lds.home" setting in .vscode/settings.json. You can create this file by copying the settings.json.template file.
- Clone this repo to your preferred location. Open terminal and navigate to .../thirdplace/tp-api/
    - Run `sh gradlew`
- If using VScode, install the Java Language extension pack. Available at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack
    - Gradle may not be immediately visible as an extension in vscode. Try creating a new gradle project with Ctrl+Shift+P -> Gradle: Create Gradle Java Project (Advanced) and follow the steps. See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-gradle/issues/1462 for more
- Ensure you can build and run by using `sh gradlew build` and `sh gradlew run`
